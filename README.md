This project is a relational database model I designed based on a real world case where a hotel director needed to manage multiple hotels, rooms, clients, and reservations 
more efficiently. I started by analyzing the given ERD and then built the database using SQL. The structure includes six main entities: Hotel, Room, category,employee and type.
Each one has a set of relevant attributes, and I used primary and foreign keys to keep the data consistent and clean. The goal behind this was not just to practice SQL syntax,
but to really understand how database relationships work logically and how theyâ€™re implemented in a way that supports scalability.
I used MySQL for this and managed the scripts through VS Code.
